"1779","Title had me ready to write a rant. Gratz mate!!"
"764","Was on the brink of ending it all"
"250","It was a total bait. I remembered yesterday's post about something related to this and thought it was a rebuttal lol"
"201","It is important to keep in mind that imposter syndrome is real and also very difficult to self diagnose. This is why asking for feedback is important. I imagine you are a junior dev so you should hopefully have a senior or tech lead type person you can go to. I have a Jr dev on my team who thinks very low of himself despite my encouragement due to a heavy case of imposter syndrome. But he builds out great solutions and I very much trust his judgment. This career rewards tenacity and dedication in spades.To answer your question yes anyone can become a good developer. Very few take to it naturally, and I say this as someone who did a ton of tutoring/teaching both academically and professionally. The job will have you learning throughout the entire course of your career. The "bad" developers are usually people who become complacent or stagnant in a space that required more momentum and continued learning. No where is this more intense than in your years as a junior. The problems you tackle as you grow do tend to be more complex but done so with a good deal of experience that allows you to brake things down into small solved issues.The areas where I see the most Jrs struggle are:Tacking an issue all at onceIt pays to brake some of the bigger problems down to workable components. many times I see young devs get into coding with out doing this.Poor debugging skillsThis comes with time, but there are many resources to help you along the way as you develop the tools needed to tackle some of the more tricky situations that come up. I usually start wide and then start isolating code till I get as close as possible to where the bug starts. The debugger wont always just point it out. Most of the nastiest bugs are logic bugs. Google is a good friend for some of the more common issues.Asking for help too soon or to lateThis one is a hard balance, but anytime you hit a wall try to use it as a learning opportunity. This can't always be this way, especially if there are time constraints. The same way you don't want to consistently hit up your senior/tech lead for every little thing, bashing your head against a problem for hours is also not great. Suggestion here would be to just talk this out with who ever is responsible for your growth on the team. (Be it officially or unofficially) In my case I tell my Jr's to just hit me up and I will let them know if they should dig deeper or if it's something I know they wont find quickly. I tend not to just outright give them the answer but help them think through it.Not giving yourself enough timeUnless it is the first hour of the morning, and you already know how to fix/do what is being asked. Never utter the words "I will get it done today" unprompted. You will never know what will hit you that day or the thing you need to do could end up being more time consuming.Not working on your writing skillsThis stuff is fundamentally essential to not just creating amazing documentation, your team will love you for; It also helps getting your point across in the many many many many many emails you will need to write.While on communication! Work these soft skills outActively listening is very important. I have seen people with lesser technical skills beat out others for a job/promotion due to their ability to communicate. This happens, don't let that be you.Last but certainly not lest. Continue learningThis tends to be more relevant to people shifting up from a Jr position, where everyday is learning, to a more advanced role. Just always keep learning, if not for fun than at lest to support the environment you develop in.Enjoy the vast amount of unsolicited advice from someone who should have been asleep at lest 3 hours ago. If you do end up quitting, which I hope you don't. The problem solving skills you picked up are very transferable. Best of luck, and if you have any questions feel free to reach out."
"182","Me too man, with all the people saying it's rigged ohh it's saturated, I was like whats the point and thats me I'm very young and hardworking. Fuck this I'll delete reddit and just fucking focus."
"130","My question is: can anyone be a good dev? I've been working as a dev for a year and I think I'm shitty dev and that I will never be good at it. So I'm thinking to quit.But good for you. Dev career is a great place with lots of oportunities for those who can actually know how to code."
"127","My favourite engineering company is Nestle"
"108","this is the reality, it's not possible to learn and get a job in 2 months.by the way congrats"
"93","It’s Nestle"
"72","Hang in there, saturated with shitty devs is exactly right. I can only speak for myself, but I think algo problems are useful--not for making sure you can "think right" or get an answer, but because they will expose people who don't really understand how to construct a loop or access the second to last letter of a string, etc. All I'm looking for in a junior is a solid grasp of the fundamentals and enough HTML/CSS/framework stuff to be dangerous, and it's surprising how many candidates--even those who supposedly have a couple of years experience--can't show it."
"70","I know you will not prefer to say the name of the company but Im really curious because its rare these days that people give such great reviews about their companies"
"57","I needed to hear this today! Thank you!"
"54","It is rigged. Put yourself in the best position to attempt to beat the rig."
"50","Do everything you can to show it.Have a polished github page, with a couple pinned projects that have clean code and well manicured Readmes on them.Have a professional, well formatted, and tailored resume for the position you are applying to. (include links to github/linkedin/portfolio)Have a dope portfolio site with projects that help you stand out.Make sure projects are hosted. If they have any type of auth, make sure recruiters/hiring managers can bypass auth with guest login.Have an active Linkedin with a professional headshot, lots of connections, links to your github and resume, maybe even write articles on there and make (professional) postsCommunicate openly, honestly, and professionally. Follow up on phone screenings, reach out to recruiters, attend meetups in person, try to network as much as possible.Many decisions in hiring are made in literal seconds. Make sure you look serious and well put together right out of the gate. Give as much evidence as you possibly can that you're a serious candidate."
"44","You fucking fooled that guy."
"37","Hahaha you and me both 🤣. Well played, OP"
"32",""Now I have a stable 6 figure salary and work from home at an insanely cool company."GOALS. Hell yeah"
"31","They engineer human suffering!"
"29","It’s actually a new conglomeration called NestleBlackrockFBEnron.blockchain.bit.ai. Im pretty jealous"
"27","OP has hit the nail on the head for me. I'm starting my first coding job tomorrow after constantly applying for jobs for around two years, slowly building my portfolio over time..Relentless pursuit is exactly what it is. Never give up.. ever!"
"26","Thank you. I needed that."
"25","First of all thank you for your effort, it really means a lot to me. I saved your comment so I can read it from time to time, specially when I'm in crysis regarding my current job.Your completely spot on. I can tell you are someone with lots of knowledge and I dont mean only for technical knowledge.Once more - thank you."
"24","Oh yeah, I almost bit at that bait lol. I felt my BP start to rise above it's already high level and the reply along the lines on WTF was already forming in my head. Lol"
"24","you had me in the first look, not gonna lie"
"23","Hope has been restored…"
"22","ignore anyone who says the job market is saturated...... it's all about relentless pursuitThese statements contradict each other. In a saturated market, a small number of people (only) can get a job if they pursue, relentlessly. That doesn't mean it's not a saturated market, it means it is one.If there's 10 people for each vacancy, nobody's denying that any one of them might get the job, but there will always be 9 that don't."
"21","Honestly, you will be better off doing the last part when it comes to a lot of things. Do your own research and be careful of the negative voices. The problem with the internet is you have no idea who is saying what or whether they are even worth listening to. Just be willing to work very hard at whatever it is you are going after (obvious advice I know)."
"21","As a dev team lead who wears a hiring manager hat, items 2 and 6 mean something to me and a little bit of 5. I don’t care about seeing a picture of you and, in fact, I’d rather not.I think having a polished github profile has value for the candidate because making and finishing projects is a good habit to get into, but in my experience there’s never time to look at them. I’ll be reading CVs that have already been filtered by my company’s recruiters and even then, I’m trying to do it alongside all the other work on my plate, so it’s amazing if I manage to spend five minutes per candidate before saying which ones I want to put forward for a screening call."
"20","I was literally typing bullsh.. when I decided to read a bit further."
"19","They have such good engineering"
"18","I really do love programming. I'm curious and love to learn new things...until I'm at work. Then I got overwhelmed with the amount of the informations, project logic etc. Maybe is because of the project (fintech), but Im the only one on the project who struggles, so its me not the project.Tbh I'm not the sharpest knife when it comes to math and logic. But after or year and a half of self learning and a year of work I just think I'm on a right level to be a good, even decent dev. And don't get me started talking about my coworkers lol. They are like light years in front of me.So I was thinking what to do next and your post gave me some answers. Thank you for that."
"18","That salty gatekeeper"
"17","I got my first IT job (analyst) after 2 months studying coding and networking, no degree either. It’s not standard, but anything can happen. You’ve just gotta be an extremely quick learner and be able to walk the walk."
"17","It tool me 4 years learning to code in my freetime while working help desk jobs. I ended up having to pay for a boot camp just to get recruiters to look at me (major corporations near me love to hire bootcampers). Finally got my 80k junior dev job, it will probably be a couple of years before I strike 6 figures.No regrets because there's no way I'd make this much on my previous job path, but there is no get rich quick schemes here."
"15","not the guy who replied to but I did a 16 week bootcamp that I didn't get a cert for and had 2 offers by week 15.4 years into my career now. a bootcamp arms you with some of the knowledge, the rest is attitudinal"
"13","One that I used a lot for junior and mid level developers is:Write a function that takes an array and a target number and returns any pairs in the array whose sum equals the target number. For example, with inputs of 12 and [5, 7, 3, 9, 4, 6], return [[5,7], [3,9]].Getting to a solution shouldn't be too difficult for someone who has a solid grasp of a programming language. But many solutions have problems--duplicate answers in more complex inputs, treating [5,7] as a separate answer than [7,5], should 6 count as matching itself, some solutions don't handle weird numbers well--so there's lots of room to keep going. Once a solution is working and correctly handling weird cases, if it's looping more than once try to get it down to one loop. Different candidates will spot some of these in advance and try to work around them, acknowledge them and decide to ignore them until the basic solution is in place, etc. All of this shows me whether you can write code to solve problems, how you work, etc."
"13","I've been a developer for nearly 20 years and the are 2 levels of confidence for me. I'm confident about the things I know, but I'm also confident there's way more I don't know.After all these years I've gone from not knowing something to knowing it so many times that I'm confident I can keep improving, keep expanding my skills"
"13","I was told not to even do a boot camp because it's a rip off and you can learn everything on your own. My issue is time and motivation so it might be worth it? Which camp was it and how much did you spend if you don't mind me asking? Was it full time because I'm a single mom who works full time."
"13","I recently got offered a remote job for 65k and I was ecstatic when they told me i made it. It took countless applications and a few interviews but it's so worth it. I'm not at 6 figures yet but I'm 22 so I'll take what i can get! I start next week :))"
"12","You've been doing it for a year, and they haven't kicked you to the curb, look at the results, not how you feel about getting there to try shaking the imposter syndrome.If you're stressed and struggling, but get the job done when it needs to be done, then you are doing an adequate job with room to learn and grow from your more experienced teammates. Don't discount how far you've already come by comparing yourself to people who started a different race."
"12","Catchy title. I almost gave up everything for it"
"11","Thanks for all the info! 🫂"
"11","I got one in 4 months after getting a certrare, but it happens"
"11","I did Codeclan in Scotland. I left my job + paid to do it so it was a big risk. No way could I have done it with a kid in the mix.You can learn anything in your own time but the structure of a class and a teacher who you can instantly ask for help/clarification is very helpful I found"
"11","Being a dev this is 100% true. I graduated as a sys admin. But my entry level job was boring, low paying, and had a good amount of down time. I had taken 2 java courses in college so I had a little bit of programming knowledge. I didn't like Java probably mostly because the way I was taught it, so I decided to choose to learn something similar, C#.During the downtime at my sys admin job I self taught myself C#. I got lucky because my company started wanting tiny automations like complex macros and windows forms apps. They had no idea the automation was possible and had order entry people doing the job. I volunteered to make the work automated and it grew into more complex work including an integration with an outside company.I strived to understand all the best practices and when I went to maintain my early code, I realized how important best practices were. I decided to try and land a software engineering job, I surprisingly got 2 job offers. I took one as a software engineer. After 6 years I've been promoted twice and am now a lead dev.My advice, learn as much as you can. Learn best practices. Look back at early work and see either how much you have improved or where you can improve. Knowing how much you improved will motivate you, knowing where you can still improve will give you more goals for further improvement. Be confident in your answers and stick to your guns but never believe you know everything, always keep an open mind and know you can be wrong no matter how experienced you are. This all probably can apply to many careers.If a dev and looking back at old code, imagine yourself trying to change old code you may never had to in the past. If it horrifies you just thinking about changing the code, the code is likely poor, if your new code feels the same think of ways you can improve it's maintainability. If you feel only you could change the code and would be very difficult transition to someone else, it is also likely poor and overly complex code."
"11","was your first job remote?"
"11","I think with software dev in general if you don't give up you can succeed.Again, not arguing against that. Like I said people should pursue.Also survivorship bias is kinda the point right? Don't give up and you'll be a survivor, or something like thatNo,.. not what survivorship bias means. Survivorship bias means that because you survived you incorrectly assume others will based on your subjective experience."
"10","Very true. For my first job, I was offered an interview out of bootcamp because this company that came for my showcase liked the fact that I had a loader for my app while it was fetching data. It was something so simple but to them it showed that I paid attention to details and user experience. Little things matter. Especially for a FE dev, we need to be in-tune with these visual cues so that we can give good feedback while developing."
"9","Thank you for taking the time to write this. I've recently decided to start completely over and switch to this field but all the comments make it daunting. I appreciate you being helpful and realistic."
"9","What cert?"
"9","You can definitely learn everything on your own for free, or relatively cheap. I struggle with the structure of self learning, & the fact that there's nobody there to say, "hey do this instead of that."May I ask where you are on your journey to learn?"
"9","how can i show companies that i m a good dev?"
"9","Ya know I've been working on it for about a year now. Started applying and have been rejected non stop. It's disheartening not gonna lie. I've gotten some interviews and one of them had me laughing at the end.Dude told me I was perfect for the job and even offered me a job... Kinda. Once we finished speaking he said I don't see a degree on your resume.I replied back saying I am self taught and as he can see through my GitHub page and resume I have the experience. Mind you I'm not applying for anything except junior roles because I don't feel I am ready for anything else. The guy told me well I'm sorry we can't hire you because we only hire people with degrees. It's a company standard and our clients expect it of your employees.Why waste both of our time if you can see my resume and know I don't have a degree.Kinda silly but whatever. Hoping one of these other companies will pick me up. Maybe it's the resume which is why I'm not getting a bunch of call backs."
"9","Positive story in response:It took me 6 months through a self study bootcamp. I worked HARD. I got a job offer in just under 30 days after graduation, getting paid 75k annually. 6 months later I got a raise to 83.5k, and I’m up for another raise in 5 months when I hit my one year at the company. I work 100% remotely, and work for a great company with a good company culture.30 days, about 50 applications sent, 3 screening interviews, one coding challenge, one time being pushed forward in my interview process.I got the job networking with strangers on LinkedIn. Cold outreach until someone agreed to have a phone conversation with me."
"9","OP a little too high off his ass from having a job"
"8","Cool! I'm back to college at 38 y.o.It's a 2 year short career (tittle: University Technician in Programming).Last year we learned C#. This year I think it's Java and some JS.What were your study sources ?"
"8","The market is saturated but a lot of these people churn out terrible code. It is easy to set yourself apart from the crowd when the code is terrible and unoptimized.When I started my career I had it in my head that I would be working with good devs and it got so bad I nearly ruined my entire career. The imposter syndrome hit me hard. But, once I switched jobs I quickly learned that I am just as incompetent as everyone else and there are people that are actually worse than I am. I also realized I don’t like dev work but actually love QA so that is what I do today."
"8","The rant-worthy part was the concept of being anywhere near job ready after 2 months."
"7","I started learning when I was 36 year old. I'm now 38. C# is cool, Java is quite similar to C# so maybe one day I'll try Java as well.My sources were: youtube, pluralisght and Microsoft documentation."
"7","r/fucknestle"
"7","14 weeks is a lot closer to 4 months than 2 months......"
"6","Ye, I am in that phase now. Thank God that I am not a pro nerf-gun"
"6","I disagree. The context between those two statements matters. It very well may be true that the market is saturated for junior devs (aka less than 1yr worth of projects). However if you work hard to become a dev that knows some skills (and can prove it with projects/work), the job market is suddenly not quite as saturated anymore.That's my interpretation anyway."
"5","C# along with .net. Some basic js with react. At work I mostly work with angular thou."
"5","I’m the same age as you and just starting to research programming jobs and education options. And I have a communications job I love but the pay is shit. So you aren’t alone. 😬"
"5","Nestle the N in faang confrimt?"
"5","I needed it too. Currently clawing my way through a college degree and it’s kicking my ass"
"5","Thanks for this. Congratulations on being rewarded for all the hard work"
"5","Job market is saturated?For the people saying so, where do you live? Programmers are invaluable right now to furl the technologic "revolution".I mean, thousands of companies is asking for data scientist, programmers, data crunchers, et.c. It must be the best time in world to be a programmer and, for people that aren't, learn to program."
"5","Thanks for this..I am a Frontend Dev too working remotely. In terms of technical skills and technologies, what do you suggest to learn very well?"
"4","Kinda early to give up but think about things you can do for an org that don’t involved coding. Engineering manager, PM, technical writer, developer advocate, (sometimes) QA, scrum master, etc. If you ever find that the job is not for you, leverage the experience you got from it to make a transition to something that interests you. I can say for sure a PM who has dev experience is gold for example"
"4","I wish I was joking, but my friend learnt Flutter& Dart in about 6 months and started freelancing right away, 3-4 months later he used those freelanced apps and got a high paying job.He learnt and got a job in 10 months, that's the shortest I have ever seen someone do it."
"4","they call me Nandor the Relentlessbecause I'm so relentless"
"4","People say the entry market is saturated, but it's saturated with shitty devs.In other words: The entry-level job market is saturated with entry-level devs.In an industry that is also having an issue with a lack of experienced devs, I think it's reasonable to hold the industry itself responsible for failing to cultivate that experience.OP is certainly correct that the best way to succeed in such a labor market is to, basically, not be an entry-level dev. But OP should be honest that that's what is being said in this post."
"4","Beautiful. Well Done."
"4","Needed this motivation! 🔥 Congratulations!"
"4","I have a strategy. I've done a bootcamp and that school is looking for teacher assistants. They hire illumni for that position. So, I'm going to apply, get them to pay for my bachelor than set out to the job market."
"4","Glad to hear that. I'd rather walk the path well traveled than fight my way through the jungle. It's all uphill anyways."
"4","congratulations on everything, and this is definitely a motivating post for anyone starting out​It's all about relentless pursuit. People say the entry market is saturated, but it's saturated with shitty devsbut if that wasn't true why would those 8 companies reject you? don't mean to be rude just curious what you think the reason was."
"4","For people who might be reading this, many many many remote jobs do not let you do it from "anywhere on earth".In a lot of cases you have to be in a select number of states and in most cases for US jobs you won't be allowed to live and work full time overseas."
"3","I did one basic html and one css course through Skillcrush but never did anything past that despite paying for a package. It's been awhile and i've forgotten everything already. I am toying with becoming a ux researcher because I love that stuff. I'm just nervous because I like my current job in marketing but it's embarrassing how much it pays. I'm 41 and getting such a late start is so intimidating."
"3","The only way to stay consistent is to set realistic goals and then complete then. The metric for your goals can be time or task oriented, as long as they are measurable.For example, you might want to do 1 hr per week night of learning, or one learning course a week/month.I allso worked for free on a website/database for a non profit organization I was a participant in, so having a project to work on really kept me on task."
"3","What were you doing before this position?"
"3","What are your favorite references that discuss best practices?"
"3","Woah congratulations, could you tell more? Stories like this give us strength"
"3","Yo thnxx can i just say if you don't mind i would love to see your resume you can clear out all the personal infoit's ok if you don't wanna share thanxx regardless"
"3","Demonstrate that you understand that business value is important and that technology in most cases is there to support it not the other way around.Understanding why you are truly doing something helps. Find the logic."
"3","So I assume you mostly work in C99? No but seriously what kind of stuff do you actually do as a front-end-developer? Is it all sort of web interface stuff?"
"3","Thank you for this post. Last night I was in the trough of sorrow when I couldn’t get my calculator to work in JS. This gives me hope."
"3","Ignore the noise, keep your head down, focus and never give up.That's all I tell myself when people laugh at me for having goals and aspirations that those very individuals lack the creativity and discipline to achieve."
"3","What if you’re on the wrong side of 30’s and have never been in the tech field? Asking for a friend."
"3","true, thanks for answering."
"3","So you're saying after 3.5months at a presumably expensive and intensive bootcamp you were job ready?Not after 2months then."
"3","am i the only one who would never want to work from homefrom my experience workplaces are just slightly boring frat houses"
"3","True, but anywhere in the US is still a massive incentive. Even a whole state is. That is so freeing. It’s often the difference between living with 4 roommates and owning a 3 bedroom home."
"3","I agree with you for sure. I just pretty commonly hear people who think that a remote job means they can go live on a beach in Thailand for a few bucks a day or whatever. And while some people are able to do that, yes, it is pretty uncommon. Time zones, tax laws, immigration shit, security, etc etc...."
"3","Congrats man, but that seems low, I feel like they underpaid you. Round here your average dev with experience pulls in 100k, senior devs pull 150-200k...so entry level guys should pull what, 70-80k?"
"2","i think a double for loop where you delete the first number in the list after searching would be good."
"2","What language did you learn ?"
"2","So, I must have hope! 💪😊Thanks for all the info man! 🫂"
"2","Good luck! :)"
"2","The fact that you think you're not very good is almost definitely just imposter syndrome. Happens to every single engineer I've ever talked to about it.You've earned your spot just like everybody you work with because your peers think you're a good dev."
"2","How did you stay consistent in your learning during for years ? I’m learning too but I can’t stay consistent as learning everyday"
"2","Full stack web dev type of boot camp? I’m new and trying to differentiate if a bootcamp is strictly for web dev or software applications."
"2","Sorta my point. Figured it would be good for people to hear all sorts of success stories. 😁"
"2","Do you live in the US?"
"2","This is a common path ive seen people take"
"2","congratulation to op and this post is helpful to me"
"2","The title had me stunned. Here been coding for 2 years. Pretty good at it and going for a degree in CS. Yet to make a cent from my skills."
"2","That post about the job market being saturated is also very localised.In my area there is still a massive shortage of all kinds of IT professionals."
"2","Honestly 3 years doesn't even sound too bad! Not to detract from your effort ofc, that persistence is the hard part :)"
"2","Congratulations! On average how much time a day and how many times per week did you put in?"
"2","After reading through these comments it's really helped my anxiety about my progress in learning. I'm finishing a biology degree and my grad school project was going to doing a lot of data analysis and compiling so my professor suggested getting familiar with some programming languages in order to help speed it up once we started. Since then I started the free courses in Data Camp and then moved to Coursera to learn Python. Starting out I didn't know how I'd feel about it but I've enjoyed the critical thinking and problem solving involved in how to get the desired results from a program, but at times that I get stuck I just get really down on myself that I'm not cut out to be abke to do programming. I really want to be able to continue and succeed with it and reading some of the stories in here has really helped calm down that anxiety"
"2","Perseverance Pays."
"2","I love this post. I find most people on Reddit are toxic so this is refreshing.I'm still searching myself."
"2","This is a very encouraging post, the previous post was interesting. Though a bit dour."
"2","As someone who now mainly has to hire devs I can add one other point… do NOT underestimate how important your communication skills and ability to interview are.You may be the best programmer on the planet but if you’re unable to communicate with your team and coordinate properly, you’re an albatross.Also don’t be afraid to ask for more money if you feel you’re being shafted, your pay in the future at that company will be largely percentage based, so the higher that number starts out…PS - Fun fact, you probably make more than your manager after your second position, or at least you should if your manager knows how the hell to retain good talent.Congratulations OP! Sounds like you nailed it. :)"
"2","The market isnt saturated. The junior market is. Everyone and the mother is trying to learn to program right now. Especially since covid. Its about separating yourself from the crowd as a beginner"
"2","Not OP but in other replies he said his degree is in Economics"
"2","I’ve been doing The Odin project and it’s been great. Free, make sure to join the discord. It’s been great so far."
"2","In my experience, most of the traits that make a good dev boil down to cooperating with the team - Easy to read code vs overly complex - Very little ego about the right way to solve a problem - Follows the team's conventionsTechnical stuff is a lot easier to learn than good people skills"
"2","The boot camp I took part in was 14 weeks.Probably the most grueling thing I've ever done, definitely harder the most of the college courses I ever took. Got a job the on the last day of the course. I worked my ass off for it, not everyone got offers that quick, and had to do a lot of learning on the job... But it can happen."
"2","good foundation for user experience, web accessibility and page speed skills are things i see a lot of FE devs lacking"
"2","For me WFH means I can be anywhere on earth with an internet connection. Having to spend $4000/month for an apartment in San Francisco is a massive financial drain when I could be somewhere much cheaper and maybe more desirable."
"2","I presume this is 3 Years through Higher Education?congratulations by the way!"
"2","Congrats on the job and the whole journey!I'm slowly working towards that goal as well, do you mind sharing which ressources did you use for that?"
"2","Good for you."
"1","Thanks for this - I've saved it! Great advice"

"1","Lol no worries at all. If it wasn't for them I wouldn't have thought to write that out so they are mega deserving of it."
"1","It's the soft skills that makes me anxious. I could learn technical skills. It's my poor communication skills that have been holding me back."

"1","In my opinion the best and fastest progress you make with a project.Solve a problem and you will have fun and learn a lot."
"1","Which bootcamp was it and which location may I ask?"
"1","Tech Elevator, Columbus OhioI got hired into a very large banking organization that basically hires half of the bootcampers.If this is a route you choose to go down, I 100% recommend having made your own project first, because boot camp moves FAST and self teaching helped me out immensely. I saw a lot of people struggling to keep up who were not placed in development jobs."
"1","Full stack web with Java as a back end.Basically by the end of the boot camp we made an application using: sql, Java, springboot, html, custom, vue"
"1","NestleTimeWarnerHalliburtonTraderJoes"
"1","They’re piping hot garbage for sure"
"1","It's in part of a team conducting evaluation and visualization of weather models for a forecasting company"
"1","I landed my first roll on 5 alone. Being able to network and communicate is a huge part of the role."
"1","Can I ask what bootcamps you guys went through?"
"1","Thinkful :)"
"1","Thanks so much for sharing your story! I have heard that networking/LinkedIn makes a huge difference but the idea of cold contacts is a bit intimidating to me. Would you mind saying something about your basic “script” or approach to this?"
"1","Basically I’d would just keep the focus on them. I’d find people I have e something, anything, in common with that I can talk to. Or something I find really interesting about them. I’d point that out and then tell them I’d like to talk to them more to get to know what their journey was like.People are generally very accepting to this sort of outreach. Not everyone is sure active on outreach, and some people are really busy that they don’t have time to get back, so don’t always expect a rely. Just keep writing people at companies you are interested in.Many companies have referral bonuses. At mine, we are offering $1,000 if your referral gets hired. So there is sometimes incentive to help someone get hired."
"1","Thank you, this was really helpful!"
"1","Remote jobs mean you don't need to spend extra time commuting, more freedom in where you live (don't need to live in an expensive area near your workplace), and so on. Only negative is the lack of socialization but many programmers see that as a positive"
"1","It's called survivorship bias. OP discounts all of the failures and, by their own admission, doesn't really have a clue about the industry, so why anyone is listening to them is bewlidering.As someone who hired people: the market for juniors is very saturated. OP's success doesn't negate that."
"1","OP, may I ask, what was the first language you "learned"?"
"1","I laughed so hard."
"1","My eye twitched when I first read the title."
"1","Love it!"
"1","I don’t know if what you have said is right, you given me hope so I given you upvote"
"1","Are you down for a small q & a session ? I have some questions"
"1","It’s all about experience from what i heared. I’m a first year cs student and I’m already looking for internships"
"1","That title brought me here. Congratulations Sir!"
"1","What should I learn? So many codes I’m confused… I wish you the best!"
"1","I started learning C# but I thought it might not be popular with the big corporations. But Java I’ve heard a lot about!Thank you for taking time to write this, very valuable."
"1","No problem! Good luck!"
"1","Thank you."
"1","u/browat As a complete beginner to programming who is also interested in the web develolpment field, can u give me kind of a roadmap as to which language I should learn first to get started (any courses you recommend?) and what next.. like a general guide similar to what you did?"
"1","OP, you’re a good human. Thanks."
"1","Congratulations! Nice to see a dose of reality and really good advice on reddit."
"1","So how long it took for you to actually learn ?"
"1","Would you mind elaborating more on the three years of hard work? Does that mean you pursued a degree? I have significant qualms with the higher education system and would like to disembowel most of those institutions, much less attend one if at all possible. I already know I can hash out some stuff with python based on nailing my friend's "programming" final on their behalf, so if your story involves self-teaching and stuff like that, I'd love to hear it."
"1","I want to get into the coding field, where should I start? Should I join a coding boot camp?"
"1","This is really motivating for me to go back to 100 Dev and follow through to catch up the missed classes!"
"1","Mind telling us what technology?"
"1","Thanks. I was thinking the jo market was saturated but then I changed my mind."
"1","What boot camp did you attend?"
"1","This gives me hope"
"1","Are you American working at an American company?"
"1","Where did you find the jop? Like linked in or what?"
"1","Do you have degree in computer science or you are self taught?"
"1","hard work pays off"
"1","Relentlessly pursue your goals, and you will achieve what you set out to do.This is the way."
"1","Damn. I quit my job the moment I saw your headline. Now what should I do?"
"1","I want your help"
"1","needed this! you are an inspiration!!"
"1","What's your path? Web dev?"
"1","I thought you are one of those Ivy league big brain nibbas who don't highlight that 80% of their entry to FAANG(now MAANG?) without coding background is because of their Ivy league degree. Not saying they ain't smart though."
"1","I'd fuck this guy to get some of his power"
"1","Congratulations! If you don’t mind sharing, what is your official title?"
"1","Is it self taught or did you go to school?"
"1","I have a CS degree but only basic coding from c++ and python, but I need months and months of self-teaching to be able to say I can code in python, and then I can find a bootcamp for $ 6k and THEN I can apply for a job. I’m already 36 and tired."
"1","Your post title drew me in. Learning the reality forces me to ask.I remember learning a small amount of some language in high school and pretty sure we got a small course in VBasic at college.As someone who aspired to work as a video game developer when younger, is there any recommendation you could give for someone effectively starting from scratch.What language ought I learn? Aside from video game development is there any focus that could be useful that I should approach? I'd love to learn to code I just don't have the understanding to know what I'd code.And yeah, I could Google it for sure, but humor me on the basis I'd like the human aspect. Someone whose maybe been there before and can give me insight instead of me feeling like I'm staring into an abyss.Thank you."
"1","Any advice on reputable places to learn to code? I assume where you learned is a big factor for employers since it’s so competitive."
"1","best post I think I've ever seen on this sub. thank you.a lot of people need to hear this."
"1","Where do I start? I’m a novice."
"1","People say the entry market is saturated, but it's saturated with shitty devs. Become a good dev and you will have companies crawling to your door to hire you and keep you as well.Yeah, well, if I could get past the ATS that'd be great.I don't want to hear it's my resume. I've changed my resume a thousand times already. I'm bitter and angry and I hate searching for a job."
"1","Ignore the top post on this sub, ignore anyone who tells you the job market is too saturated, ignore everyone who rejects or doubts you.Agreed. Also, the only people crying about job market saturation are beginners who have little to no YOE, and they are worried all the jobs are being taken from them.I can't think of any other groups of people who would cry about made-up saturation."
"1","Just to know. Are you in the US?"
"1","OP are you self taught or CS degree ?"
"1","OP what was your major in college?"
"1","How good did you get to land a job? As in, what topics did you learn well and could you describe what projects helped you land that job? Thanks in advance!"
"1","Awesome!! Congratulations!! Which courses did you take ?"
"1","Great post"
"1","What separates a good dev from a shitty one, attention and care for quality? Creativity?"
"1","I’m a year into learning to work on the Salesforce platform. Proud of you stranger! That’s the dream."
"1","where I live the job market is saturated with want ads for programmers. so much that I wish I had taken software engineering instead of electrical"
"1","That title was about to be the single most motivating title I've ever read. I was like DAMN if this person can do it then there's no way I can't."
"1","Thanks. I needed this today."
"1","Is it normal working hours for the remote job?"
"1","Haha awesome post. But if I'm supposed to ignore the top post... I'm confused now. System overload"
"1","What work? Type? Languages? Base location of company?"
"1","What a motivational prep talk with a sticky title, nice mate!"
"1","Congratulations man"
"1","Hey man, love your passion. As a developer who is married to a dev recruiter, can confirm it is a developer’s market for sure. There is all the opportunity in the world for someone willing to put in the work."
"1","Enjoy the fruits of your hard work., am here still trying to get past the basics."
"1","Never give up friends."
"1","This is true. My company ALWAYS has dev positions open, because it's hard to find good devs. The problem is we only hire really competent developers. The only entry level devs we hire are from our intern programs."
"1","This was actually true in the 90's (except the remote bit)."
"1","I feel like the legitimate time frame to tell ppl going from zero is 1-2 years. 100k maybe not, but a $75k job in 1.5 years to me doesn't seem unrealistic."
"1","Did you go to college? What was your major?"
"1","Would it be possible to see your resume so I have a good idea of what a good resume would look like? I’m just getting to the point of starting to apply myself"
"1","Based on your title I bought a brand new pitchfork and torch. Now I have to see if I can return them... well done!"
"1","Dick! Had me fooled!!"
"1","Same, my current job is good and my future prospects look pretty good. Took me about 3 and a 1/2 years of building stuff that seemed like junk but was teaching me a lot. Just keep writing and reading code bros(broettes).I even took breaks from coding entirely when i was learning but i still thought about it, read about it, and thought about the kind of stuff i could try to build. I think 3 to 4 years of consistent problem solving and serious investigation of multiple tools used In real work flows will get you a job.Try to get freelance work, build shit for friends and family even if its free …. You don’t have to complete every project you start, but complete the component(s) of the project that demonstrates the project concept is sound. Cloud certificates can be valuable, but at the very least cloud resources let you prototype with tools you might not have on the cheap.Its a massive industry with lots of openings and the core work force is retiring or about to retire. Get the fundamentals down, find the course that speaks to you that is geared towards teaching you the foundations of any and all languages. Then read and write code as much as your brain can handle."
"1","Holy shit. I was abt to doubt my entire existence."
"1","Nice buddy"
"1","Great one!! I came in hot ready to be like this mfkr...Random inquiry: Resume. Was it important? Did you have to change it up multiple times? I have yet to land a first interview... I've had a few different formats, I like the current format the best. But still, no interviews.If you happen to run across this comment... How long did it take to get your first interview?"
"1","It's been around 3 years for me now. Just started applying for jobs this week (junior so not 6 figures yet!) and the first weekend test I got is already overwhelming. But I am really looking forward to working in this field :)"
"1","May I ask, are you an IT graduate? :3 really thinking of shifting my career."
"1","what are your exact certs"
"1","we love to see posts like this"
"1","My brother got a job at Oracle right out of college, working with the cloud. I’m 10 years older than him and try to teach him a few things, but he’s young and thinks he knows it all. He tells me everyone pawns all their work ok him and he does everything.So you’re doing all the work and you’re all getting paid the same?!! But he knows best 😅"
"1","Thanks. I think your positivity is justified then. It's a good outlook to have, as long as you know life is nuanced lol.I don't mean to try to be negative. I really support stories of achievement through hard work, and happy for you success."
"1","Do you know if someone abroad would get the same salary?"
"1","U lucky asf"
"1","Congratulations again! I always get excited to hear people succeeding in non traditional paths. Keep it up!"
"1","Was is math heavy?"
"1","Thank you! Posts like yours definitely help me keep my chin up :)"
"1","ty helps a lot :)"
"1","LETS GO!"
"1","Which code language did u learn?"
"1","When I finished reading title... I started opening the window... Not for the fresh air.."
"1","I was almost having a heart attack when I read the title. Thanks OP!"
"1","Is 42 too late to start?I look quite young for my age and my brain is still very very sharp I have a touch of ADD and I'm a bit on the spectrum I always thought I would be good at code as I get really into things and go deep down complex rabbit holes I have an ability to stay focused on something interesting to me for a very long time.I've always been really technically inclined I've been building and fixing electronics since a kid.I just wonder if ageism is going to be a problem for me trying to get a job"
"1","I’m about a month or so into picking up programming in my 30s. It still feels near impossible that I’ll ever be competent enough to get a good job doing it but damn it I’m going to keep plowing forward."
"1","Thank you. I needed that."
"1","I would like to start learning. Where to start?"
"1","People say the entry market is saturated, but it's saturated with shitty devs.The truth right here holy shit. Couldn't have said it better. If you have solid basics, passions and are a decent human being you will be able to find a job. You just have to learn hard and keep pursing."
"1","If you are really good, you will get hired regardless of your age in this industry."
"1","Ayyyy! Congrats! Did you do college, bootcamp or self taught?"
"1","I’m worried that coding will be too hard. Honestly I’m terrible at learning other languages and I’m worried I’m not going to be able to learn it"
"1","3 years is still good time, I am in the industry for 10 years and just reached $100k, then again I live in India. If not for remote work availability, I would not have been able to do that even today."
"1","my blood pressure totally did not rise a bit after reading the title."
"1","Take a bow!"
"1","I was livid at first when I just read your title"
"1","Wow — so great, glad to hear it does really happen and also the truth about how long it took. Good for u! Can u give more info about ur training?"
"1","I stopped programming for a few years about four years ago, heading into my 40s.I applied for *checks clipboard* 525 programming jobs in 2 months during COVID. I only heard back from 4 (well, here 'heard back' means 'a non-automated response').I'm currently on 90k+. Not a top-tier job but it pays the bills and I live in a two-bedroom apartment by myself (my girlfriend has her own place and she shall not incur upon my freeeedom).I also know a decent amount of React, a little Vue, a smidge of Angular, PHP/C++/C#(Xamarin Mobile)/JS/NodeJs/Electron/Typescript/CSS3/HTML5/some Java/some Python/some Ruby/some Flutter + Dart/Bash scripting/Various SQL languages/Photoshop/Gimp/iMovie/Shopify/Polaris/Wordpress/some Magento/Bamboo + Confluence + Jira programming and everything in-between.It's all doable if you put your mind to it, get some Anki flashcards, practise some exercises, and push yourself a bit. I have about 4 other hobbies, so I'm not programming all the time and I have a life.I'm an okay dev. I get by. You can too.Please note: I finished a Computer Systems Engineering degree in 2004 (missed out on getting a PS2 scholarship due to crappy parents). I worked for a few years doing Python programming for cheap because of low self-esteem. I haven't worked more then 3-4 years in the comp sci field at a time."
"1","I have been working for 2 years and I have a 8k per annum office job..I was about to cry reading that headline."
"1","Thanks."
"1","My question is what did you do specifically? Steps or big picture ideas?"
"1","that’s amazing, I aspire to be like you. Reddit silver coming right up"
"1","OP, what did 3 years of studying look like for you? Also did you decide you weren't going to settle for an entry level position and go straight for senior dev?"
"1","lmao"
"1","Oh yeah well I learned to code in 1 month and got a remote job for 200k"
"1","Quit a miserable job last October and picked up programming since. It's hard for me as I was on a completely different (computer-averse) path beforehand, but I love it for the most part. Job search part has been rough though lol"
"1","Grit"
"1","In the span of 3 years I moved from spain to the UK, learnt English, got into university in London, interviewed for 2 companies and got 1 offer for an internship on my first year. Anything is possible if you put the effort and time."
"1","I really needed to hear this, loved the clickbait 🤣"
"1","Can I ask how you did it? Did you take the traditional route and obtained a bachelors degree or did you teach yourself to code or took a boot camp course?"
"1","When I read that title I was foaming at the mouth ready to kill"
"1","At first I was like HOWWW??? Because as a recent grad student I can't seem to find a job anywhere that I started to lose hope and with inflation, I feel like I'm going to be stuck at home with my parents for the rest of my life. But the ending really gave me hope. Thank you"
"1","Life is about relentless pursuit."
"1","My question is did you already have some serious computer knowledge or where you just an average jo that decided to learn programming and jumped right in?"
"1","Yep, there is less and less competition as the path gets harder and harder to tread. That's what I call stability."
"1","It took me twenty years in the industry (thirty years of hobby programming) to land my first dev job, but it was at $200k. Booyah."
"1","My motto has always been "if you manage to be above mediocre, you have already beaten over 50% of the competition" or something to that effect.Sure, there are still lots of people who are better than you, but most companies still need programmers, or any kind of job really, to do the work.Sure, you might not be C level material, but look at the average person, average worker, average student.If you beat them, you have won the race."
"1","At the moment, I am still learning HTML and CSS, so I will do my best. Congratulations on landing a remote job for 100k! These jobs are often well-paying. A 100k salary is pretty good. By the way, I came across this guy (Internet Made Coder) on YouTube. He learned to code in four months and got hired as a software engineer without any CS degree. Since then, he has become a self-taught software engineer. His YouTube channel contains quality coding content. You can check out his channel by clicking the link above."
"1","This gives me hope. I'm getting a new laptop soon and plan to start learning how to code/program. I'm autistic and have anxiety, so college, especially onsite campus learning is out of the question for me. So I plan to do a few online courses. I do hope to overcome my anxiety with time and medication, but I'm far from that point right now.Relentless pursuit and being the best dev I can be are cornerstones in my decision to pursue this career despite those assertions commonly made in regards to the field of software.I personally don't think I'll be able to fully grasp programming and have a job in the same timeframe as OP. But, I hope that I DO accomplish similar goals someday. Persistence and commitment are key."
"1","I started with $70K, in 4 years time I now make $180K - business development and sales (background in engineering). Now I am interviewing with Amazon for a $650K non-technical sales/business development job. You don’t have to be a technical guy to make those big bucks either. But congratulations!"
"1","Thanks buddy. I don’t know if they will hire me but hey, they are interviewing me and aligned that they can pay me $650K, that’s good enough to know I am doing everything right in career. I have been also interviewing for director level positions with $400K packages outside of Amazon as well. Either way, it’s a big jump. So never stop jumping 🆙"
"1","For sure, def not blaming you for getting your experience"
"1","Thanks a lot for that, I'll dig it later. Congrats once again!"
"1","Had me in the first half, ngl"
"-1","Same😭"
"-1","what language are you coding in from the beginning?"
"-1","The fact that companies are looking for CS is not a passing trend. The fact that many now learns to code, and are looking for junior jobs, is.In leue of the pandemic many jobs will go back to normal. Nurses, teacher, construction workers, academic scientists and whatnot. But it's my firmest belief that, in the future, the companies will have a higher need for CS than the people who goes through learning CS/coding.But that's my 2 cents. I know sht about jobs, I'm working my first as a laboratory technician. I work 0 with computers. But on my free time I'm learning more about coding and I'm pursuing R and Python now just because I want to be able to visualise my data when I take a MSc (+PhD maybe)."
"-1","I would agree a very intelligent person could do this I don't get the down votes necessarily besides that you argued with op and the point they made was fantastically awesome"
"-1","Manforce?"
"-1","Applied to like 100+ jobs, attended the CS job fair at my college. Virtually 0 interest from any application and the recruiters at the job fair laughed at me for having an econ degree and attending the CS fair.Attended a 3 month bootcampYour OP is so disingenuous."
"-2","Happy Cake day!"
"-2","Happy Cake day! :p"
